 estate_strategoi_desc:0 "The Strategoi were the military generals of the Empire during the 7th and 8th century. Upon the establishment of the Theme System, which settled the Empire's field armies, their roles also ended up including provincial governance. Due to the initial size of the original themes, they held great power, often being rebellious and in conflict with the Emperor. Later on however, as the original themes were split up, as well as new Themes being established in newly conquered territories, their inidividual power waned substantially. Their responsibility as provincial governors ended up being moved to a group called the kritai, or judges. The Empire also saw the introduction of Doukes and Katepano, who governed several Themes at a time, as well as the reintroduction of the Domestikoi as senior generals. The Themata saw their end after the battle of Manzikert in 1071, when the Seljuks took over most of Anatolia. The remaining western themes were later abolished and were replaced by the Tagmata, which ended up as the main military force fielded by the Byzantines up until their fall in 1453. \n Now that the Theme System has been re-established, their position as provincial holders and leader of field armies settled in our lands have finally been revitalized. Provinces designated to the Strategoi are designated Theme capitals and will serve as seats of military governance in their respective state."

Referring to themselves as miaphysites, believeing that Christ has one nature that is both human and divine, they gradually separated from the then Chalcedonian belief to form their own branch of christendom.

As the christian influence grew in the Roman Empire, there came to be three more seats of patriarchs; Antioch, Jerusalem & Alexandria, all who after the Muslim conquests were never reinstated. As the Ottomans centuries later conquered Constantinople, The Ecumenical Patriarch became defunct.

Once the city fell to the Roman Empire after a disastrous siege, however, the city was left in such a poor state that it was considered uninhabitable. Emperor Hadrian in year 130 vowed to rebuild the city of Jerusalem as a gift to the Jewish people and restore the Second Temple that had been so thoroughly destroyed. When visiting the ruins, however, he was advised that rebuilding it would cause the Jews to rebel against the Empire. As such, Jerusalem instead was rebuilt into a Roman colony, including temples for Roman paganism. Perhaps ironically, this sparked an event known as the Bar Kokhba revolt, one of three conflicts conducted between the Roman Emperors and the Jews. This uprising enraged Hadrian, who put down the revolt and placed a ban on the Jewish people, prohibiting them from ever setting foot in the city except on the day of Tisha B'Av. Entering the city on any other day as a Jew was punishable by death. The city was renamed Aelia Capitolina and the roman province changed from Judea to Syria Palestina. As such, the city was transformed into a soldier camp up until Emperor Constantine I, when the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was built and the city's See was granted special honour, to later on become the seat of a Patriarch. These events resulted in the city becoming completely depopulated of Jews, which remained the case for the remainder of Roman rule. The Arabs later conquered the city, but the Jewish people would not return to their city until much later (Aside from a brief period under Saladin and the Ottomans). \n As the city once more is in Roman hands, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will get to decide its future."

However, as the Empire's influence and power waned after the battle of Mantzikert when the Seljuks settled in Anatolia, the area saw the arrival of Latin merchants in the Black Sea, which was expanded greatly after the events of the 4th Crusade. In return for the Genoese helping in recovering Constantinople, the then Emperor of Nicaea Michael VIII Palaiologos would expel the Venetians from the Black Sea in favor of the Genoese. While Michael did indeed expel the Venetians from the Black Sea strait, the Empire would never recover and its power would keep waning as the encroaching turks conquered more and more of the Empire. \n Considering that the Empire has now risen from the ashes, we have reason to offer a treaty to the Genoese merchants that greatly increases their trade potential, in exchange for placing their Black Sea trading posts directly under our rule."

Some historians revere them as the counterpart of the Legionnaires of Rome as a symbol of their military might.

 #Greek Fire
 flavor_BYZ.37.t:0 "The Rediscovery of Greek Fire"
 flavor_BYZ.37.d:0 "Greek Fire was the name given to the substance deployed by the Greeks, both on water with their Dromons and later on land with catapults. The more famous ship variant was deployed by method of a \"siphon\", a tube-shaped projector, whereas the land version on catapults was deployed through soaking cloth-clad caltrops in the substance. Said to be invented by Kallinikos from Heliopolis in Phoenice when he arrived to Constantinople in 672, it was used with great success in combating the Arabs, supposedly playing an integral part in repelling them from the 1st (674-678) and 2nd (717-718) siege of Constantinople. It later on also played a part in some decisive victories against the Saracens under the resurgence of the Macedonian dynasty, civil wars as well as during wars against the Bulgars and the Rus'. Said to not be extinguished by water, it was revered highly among the Byzantines. In the famous book called De Administrando Imperio, it was described as a gift from the heavens, a divine intervention, claimed to have been \"shown and revealed by an angel to the great and holy first Christian emperor Constantine\". The recipe was guarded heavily in an attempt to make sure it never fell into enemy hands. Despite this, the substance itself was successfully acquired by the Empire's enemies, such as the Bulgars and the Arabs, however they never replicated the method of deployment used by the Byzantines. Instead, in the case of the Arabs, similar incendiary substances were deployed with catapults and grenades instead of \"by siphon\". There is however one account where the Crusaders claim to have seen the Saracens use \"Greek Fire\" in the 13th century. What the substance itself consisted of was never known; some early accounts claim it to be based on niter or phosphide, however most scholars today claim it to be based on naphta, crude oil, perhaps gathered from the wells in the Black Sea around Tamatarcha (Today called Taman) or the Middle East. This in part may explain the sudden disappearance of Greek Fire following the sack of Constantinople in the 4th crusade, never to be used by the Byzantines again."

 #Renovatio Imperii incorporated units for Eastern tech, only slightly altered certain text to remove some present tense, as well as slightly altering the description of Themata Infantry as the Theme System is re-established differently in this mod.
 #Three units were skipped: Preobrazhensky Infantry, Eastern Jaegers and Russian Reformed Mass Infantry. The reason being that the mod makes it so that Eastern units are on par with Western, giving the Russian Mass Infantry at tech 28 instead of 30, which I don't necessarily agree with.
 #The Jaeger is skipped because all Eastern units adapted from Western usually appear a tier later than they do in Western. Since Jaegers are the final tier, I argue there is no way they can appear at the same time, unless you add another unit tier after tech 30, which I'm not ready to do. If I would, then the Reformed Mass Infantry could exist as well.
 #The Preobrazhensky is skipped because this is already represented in the Petrine infantry, which is both the Preobrazhensky and the Semyonovsky, meaning it should've been a tier earlier.
 #Besides, the mod also introduces the reformed Petrine to work beside the Green Coat as a more defensive alternative. Giving 3 different Russian infantry is a bit too much in my opinion. Since I also moved Reformed Varangians to this spot, I think that's fair.

 varangian_infantry:0 "Varangian Infantry"
 varangian_infantryDESCR:0 "The Varangian Guard was an elite unit of the Byzantine Empire during the era of the Makedon dynasty through the early Palaiologan Dynasty. Recruited from the Scandinavians, Russians, and later Englishmen, the Varangians were feared for their tremendous fighting strength. Due to their status as foreigners in the Empire, they were largely kept out of the many political intrigues preventing them from being used against the Emperor. The Varangian Guard was disbanded during the 14th century due to the decline of the Empire, but was reconstituted by Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos in the mid 15th century. The reformed Varangian Guard not only consisted of mercenaries from the Russian region, but also were recruited from the Balkans and Anatolia as well. Serving in the Varangian Guard not only paid well for these mercenaries, but was also a chance to attain Byzantine citizenship as well, which bound the new Varangians to the Empire more tightly then other mercenary companies were to other states in the renaissance era."

 themata_infantry:0 "Themata Infantry"
 themata_infantryDESCR:0 "With the Byzantine Empire surviving the Ottoman onslaught and reconquering their lands, Emperor Demetrios III restored the imperial provincial administration known as the Theme System. Much like how the Theme System operated in previous eras, soldiers in the Imperial Army were given parcels of land in reward for serving in the military. These were not permanent land grants, as the lands officially belonged to the Emperor. As long as the family kept working the land, they and their kin were expected to serve in the Imperial Army. This served to provide manpower to the Imperial Army without resorting to conscription, a process that was very unpopular with the citizens of the Empire. What is noticably different about the troops that were raised under the restored system is that rather than being local defensive militias, the infantry were professional troops that were heavily trained and disciplined. Each theme was reorganized as a self-contained army, and soon begin to reflect the same characteristics as the earlier Legionary system had. Only Byzantine citizens were allowed to join a theme, and each theme had a single area in the Empire that they were associated with. This created a bond between the theme, and the locality that it was recruited from, as well as promoting traditions in the military. Some of the most famous themes to serve the Empire in the early modern era was Thema Thrakes, who finally put an end to the Ottoman Sultanate in 1573, Thema Optimaton who was instrumental in the reconquests of Antioch and Jerusalem as well as leading the seige of Mecca, and Thema Makedonikon, who along with the Varangian Guard and the Palatines were responsible for the rout of the Papal Coalition in 1661." 
 palatine_cavalry:0 "Palatine Cavalry"
 palatine_cavalryDESCR:0 "The Palatines were an elite cavalry unit in the Byzantine Imperial Army. Riding far ahead of the Imperial Army, the Palatines would engage in raids and irregular warfare designed to disrupt the enemies organizational capabilities and infrastructure before the main army advanced into the region. The Palatines were one of the earliest examples of a special operations unit in the early modern early. Known for operating far behind enemy lines, the Palatines had an uncanny knack for forming a shock force and attacking the enemy army from behind when they could least expect it. The greatest example was the routing of the Papal Coalition in 1661, in which a coalition of the Spaniards, French, Austrians, and the various Italian city-states were fighting the Empire on the outskirts of Rome. The Palatines, back from raiding in Ancona, accidently happened upon the main supply post for the coalition in Tusculum. Taking advantage of the opportunity, the Palatines burned the outpost, which set confusion of the coalition. The timely arrival of reinforcements in the form of the Varangian Guard and the Greek themes broke the back of resistance, and the coalition was defeated."
 hajduk_infantry:0 "Hadjuk Infantry"
 hajduk_infantryDESCR:0 "Footsoldiers inspired by the Balkan and Carpathian militaries that formed the backbone of the Polish infantry from the 1570s until about the 1630s. Unusually for this period, Polish-Lithuanian hajduks wore uniforms, typically of grey-blue woolen cloth, with red collar and cuffs. Their principal weapon was an arquebus. For close combat they also carried a heavy variety of sabres."
 scholarian_infantry:0 "Scholarian Infantry"
 scholarian_infantryDESCR:0 "The Scholarians were the infantry of the Byzantine Empire that was established in the military reforms by Constantine XII Palaiologos in the mid 17th century. The themata infantry had previously began adopting practices from the Legions, including creating a professional fighting force backed by highly disciplined troops. The military reforms not only increased support of the professionalization of the Imperial Army, the Emperor also enacted into Law the Military Education Act. Citizens joining the military were not only expected to be able to read and write, they were also schooled in tactics, drills, techniques, and formations as well. This typically took a total of three years to complete. Once a soldier graduated from the military school, he would become a full-fledged member of the Imperial Army. The heavy focus of education not only on the officers, but also on the rank and file caused other nations to began referring to these soldiers as Scholarians. This emphasis on quality meant that the Imperial Army was not able to maintain a massive army, as many potential recruits would not be able to pass the schooling. However, the quality resulting from the graduates far outstripped the drawbacks from not having a large pool of recruitments. It was not uncommon to see a single theme of Scholarians beat back a force three times their own size, as was demonstrated in the Papal Wars in the 1660's. The uniforms of the Scholarian took on an heavy emphasis on Eastern fashions, wearing red fez caps, red jackets, yellow shirts, and red Bracca, a type of light breeches. Rather than carry western style arms, the Scholarians sported arms from the Middle East, preferring their simplicity compared to more western arms."

Not only was the Palatine used in irregular warfare, they were also used in shock attacks against enemy formations much more frequently. Therefore, they had to adapt to becoming a heavy cavalry force."
 reformed_varangian_infantry:0 "Reformed Varangian Infantry"
 reformed_varangian_infantryDESCR:0 "The evolution of the Byzantine Imperial Army, especially with the establishment of the Theme System and the creation of the Scholarians meant that the Varangian Guard was slowly losing their place as the shock troops of the Empire. In addition, the professionalization of militaries in Europe led to a decline in military companies, as less and less nations were willing to hire mercenaries when they had their own, much more loyal forces to count on. This lead to military reforms which addressed the issue of the declining utility of the Varangians."

The Palatine Lancers could be regarded as one of the last examples of heavy cavalry in the Empire."
