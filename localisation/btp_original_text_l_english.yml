The English Kings, distracted by their designs on France, have allowed their authority in Ireland to collapse to a small strip of coastline centred on Dublin, the Pale.

 irish_clann:0 "Clann"
 irish_clann_ruler:0 "Rí"
 irish_clann_ruler_female:0 "Banríon"
 irish_clann_desc:0 "Clanns were the primary political and social unit in Gaelic Ireland. The system was highly stable, but its power structures were exceptionally weak in 15th century Europe and its largely rural population unable to compete in a modernising Europe."
 provincial_kingdom:0 "Provincial Kingdom"
 provincial_kingdom_ruler:0 "Rí Ruireach"
 provincial_kingdom_ruler_female:0 "Banríon Ruireach"
 provincial_kingdom_desc:0 "Ríthe Ruireach, or Overkings (also often call Ríthe Cúige, or Provincial Kings), were influential local kings, exercising their power over one of the ancient provinces of Ireland. Historically second only to the High King, and indeed being the candidates from which most High Kings were chosen, these local kings were some of the most powerful men in Gaelic Ireland. Despite their influence, however, they often lacked the power structures and centralisation of larger European states, though not to the extent of the local Clann chiefs."
 high_kingship:0 "High Kingship"
 high_kingship_ruler:0 "Ard Rí"
 high_kingship_ruler_female:0 "Ard Banríon"
 high_kingship_desc:0 "The highest level of kingship in Gaelic Ireland. High Kings were crowned at the Aonach, an assembly of the leading men in Gaelic Irish society, at Teamhair na Rí. Though the exact reach and totality of the High King's authority varied over time, all other kings in Ireland were at the very least nominally subordinate, if not directly subservient, to the High King. The High Kingship also revives the traditional Tanistry system of succession, making it very difficult for a dynasty to lose power or be inherited by another kingdom."
 norman_lordship:0 "Norman Lordship"
 norman_lordship_ruler:0 "Earl"
 norman_lordship_ruler_female:0 "Lady"
 norman_lordship_desc:0 "Norman Lordships are positions created by Anglo-Norman powers following the Norman conquest of Ireland in 1172, into which they installed loyal Anglo-Norman lords as a reward for miltary service as well as to ensure continued control over Ireland. Nominally vassals of the English monarch, these lordships were de facto independent by the 15th century, and shared far more with their Gaelic neighbours than their distant English cousins."
 norman_duchy:0 "Hiberno-Norman Duchy"
 norman_duchy_ruler:0 "Duke"
 norman_duchy_ruler_female:0 "Duchess"
 norman_duchy_desc:0 "A title granted by the English monarchy empowering the holder to rule one of the ancient provinces of Ireland in their name. Historically a replacement for the native provincial kingdoms, this title came to represent pervasive and aggressive English influence in Ireland, but they were also highly effective at squeezing out every last ducat from their subjects."
 anglo_irish_monarchy:0 "Anglo-Irish Monarchy"
 anglo_irish_monarchy_ruler:0 "King"
 anglo_irish_monarchy_ruler_female:0 "Queen"
 anglo_irish_monarchy_desc:0 "A form of constitutional or representative monarchy based on the English parliamentary tradition of Westminster, with a parliament called regularly by the ruling monarch. It is based on the privileges defined in Magna Carta and adapted to the local economy."
