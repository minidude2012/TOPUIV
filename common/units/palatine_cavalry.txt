# Palatine Cavalry, taken directly from Renovatio Imperii. Used with permission.

type = cavalry
unit_type = eastern

maneuver = 2
offensive_morale = 4
defensive_morale = 3
offensive_fire = 0 #Down from 1 to match BT Miscellanea's 17 pips at this stage's cavalry. The given localized description seems to detail very little about them using firearms at all anyway, rather focusing on their shock tactics. Basically it's an eastern hussar with a bit more fire defense and more offensive focus, which I think looks good.
defensive_fire = 2
offensive_shock = 5 #Up from 4, see below.
defensive_shock = 3 #Down from 4, moved one defensive pip to offensive in order to signify their raiding use
