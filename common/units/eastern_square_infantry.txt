# Eastern Square Infantry, taken directly from Renovatio Imperii. Used with permission.

unit_type = eastern
type = infantry
#Sadly is has exactly the same pips as the Western Square Infantry, but I cannot find a good pip distribution that describes it without deviating from its role - To stop assaults and being defensive.
#I could increase defensive fire at the expense of offensive morale, but that would give 7 fire pips, which is way too overpowered for infantry (Especially since mass infantry is only 5 fire)

offensive_morale = 4 #Up from 3 to match the Western Square
defensive_morale = 4

defensive_fire = 3 #Down from 4. The square was more focused on breaking assaults using continuous volleys.
