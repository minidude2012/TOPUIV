# Balanced Eastern Musketeers, taken directly from Renovatio Imperii. Used with permission.

#God, these have been a pain to balance. Basically in BT Miscellanea, the Offensive Musketeers have a 1/2 fire, 2/1 shock and 2/2 morale, and the Defensive Musketeers have a 1/2 fire, 1/2 shock and 2/2 morale
#So, 3 fire, 3 shock and 4 morale pips. 3 is not evenly divisible. Since Infantry Fire is 1.4 and Infantry Shock is 1.15 at this point, you cannot have something with 4 fire, 2 shock and 4 morale without making this overpowered.
#In the end, I decided on dropping the 1/2 fire pattern and change that to 2/1. To then balance the offensiveness of this I take the defensive musketeer's 1/2 shock pips.
maneuver = 1
offensive_morale = 2
defensive_morale = 2
