maneuver = 1
offensive_morale = 3
defensive_morale = 3
offensive_fire = 2
defensive_fire = 2
offensive_shock = 2 
defensive_shock = 3 #Up from 2 to keep in line with BT Miscellanea Saxon Infantry buff to 15 pips from 14. Chosen because I think Themes historically were defensive and shock is the "classic" infantry pip
