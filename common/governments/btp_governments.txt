#Do not change tags in here without changing every other reference to them.
#If adding new forms of governemnts, make sure they are uniquely named.

#Uses all 'modifiers' possible that's exported as a Modifier.

# valid_for_new_country determines which governments can be converted to normally
# allow_convert determines which governments can be force-converted to and from via CBs

#ai_will_do will only check if it's valid,and won't break unions or switch to republic from monarchy, nor check to convert to something earlier in the file.
#ai_importance determines overall 'quality' of government when government is auto-picked.

#Note that I overhauled quite a bit of this for BT, mostly in versions 2.0 and 5.0. Just something to be aware of for anyone with submods   -Draiocht
